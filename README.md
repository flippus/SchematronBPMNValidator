# What is it? || Description

This tool validates BPMN models against the offically provided XSDs of the OMG and 
a subset of the descriptive extended constraints from [Geiger (2013)](http://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/uni/fakultaeten/wiai_lehrstuehle/praktische_informatik/Dateien/Publikationen/techrep-bpmn-serialization-constraints.pdf).

Additionally, the tool checks the schema validity of all in a BPMN file imported WSDL and XML files.
Namely, the following constraints of Geiger identified by their ids can be checked through this tool:
1, 2, 6-9, 21-23, 25, 26, 28, 31, 36, 56, 76, 79, 84, 88, 95-109, 135, 146, 150, 151, 152
